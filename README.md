## Motivation

As a web developer, I am always on browser. But I don't know what I am doing everyday so the question follows, did I work today or just reading so many articles about developing or maybe I did nothing at all. I was thinking how great it would be if only I could see which websites I was visiting with ease. So I decided to write an extension to do that. I was not sure if I use the data for anything but it would be nice to see what is going on on my browser all day. Here is the project that I can manage to publish at chrome web store, and feel free to use and/or contribute the project if you would like.
